Given notebook contain model trained on uci shoulder xray data. This model is implementation of uc irvine online article .
Keras was used for implementation .

Note : Idea was to perform deep learning or traditional models on data sets to predict life cycle of implant material or suggest prosthesis looking at xray images. 
next to no publicaly availble data was found online which match those ideas .
Hence this data set was chosen which i think concentrate less on technicalities of implant  but still a worth considering dataset.
